    <h3>My Experience in PC Building</h3>
    <p>I have been building computers for close to 8 years. My first computer build was back in 2011, which was based around an AMD FX-6300 CPU. I loved the experience and have continued on to build for friends and, on occasion, a special request from a paying customer. I have always charged very little for my services, mainly for the fact that I enjoy doing it.</p>

          <h4>Software</h4>
          <h5>Operating System - Windows 10 Professional</h5>
          <p>I run Windows 10 Pro, given that the new Ryzen Architecture only supports Windows 10, which I found out when I tried to use Windows 7 Pro. Other programs I use frequently are:</p>
          <p>Steam - used for games and benchmarking/stability tests</p>
          <p>Microsoft Office 2016 - used for school assignments and productivity</p>
          <p>Mozilla Firefox - my main web browser for daily use</p>
          <p>Google Chrome - specifically used for online work, school work, and MyLab assignments</p>

          <h4>Why I chose these parts</h4>
          <h5>Best parts for the Price</h5>
          <p>I was strolling down at the local swap meet when I was drawn toward a specific package in a pile of random items. It turned out to be a 16GB kit of DDR4 RAM. I asked for the price, expecting it to be very expensive, only to find out it was $2.00, yes, I bought 16GB of DDR4 RAM for $2.00. I was excited at this point, because RAM prices was the barrier that kept me from building a new PC that I sorely needed. My entire build cost me just over $260, because I reused parts from old builds and my extra parts bin. Finding the RAM kit at the swap meet was a major cost savings.</p>
